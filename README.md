This is a data sample for 'Neural Related Work Summarization with a Joint Context-driven Attention Mechanism'.

The main folder contains 50 subfolders, and each one of them relates to a specific research paper with the copyright information removed. For each paper, the subfolder has two files named 'gold' and 'candidate', where the former stores the ground truth 'Related Work', and the latter involves the candidate sentences from 'References'.

Note that every sentence is extracted from a PDF fulltext, and we have made some post-processing to filter the noisy ones out.
